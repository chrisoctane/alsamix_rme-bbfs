## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:**
Build a modular, extensible, open-source Qt6+ALSA-based mixer/patchbay GUI for the RME Babyface Pro FS (and similar RME hardware), mimicking and expanding on TotalMix FX routing (minus DSP/FX).

* All ALSA channels/faders visible, draggable, group-move.
* Output tabs for each stereo output pair, auto-populated based on detected routing.
* “Patchbay” style canvas where each ALSA channel (as defined by the driver) can be freely positioned, saved, and used as a routing/mixer reference.
* Per-channel level, pan, stereo link, mute, solo controls.
* Support for complex routing scenarios (mono, stereo, multi-output, submixes).
* Foundation for future RME feature expansion (phantom, pad, metering, etc).

---

## 2. Technical Requirements

* **Platform:** Linux (tested Ubuntu 25.04+, kernel 6.12+)
* **Python:** 3.10+
* **PyQt6:** For modern cross-platform GUI
* **pyalsaaudio:** For full ALSA mixer/control access
* **Modular codebase:** Separation of ALSA backend, patchbay logic, and GUI main window.
* **Extensible:** Should support future RME devices (naming scheme, routing logic).
* **ALSA driver knowledge:** Code must parse/control all Babyface Pro FS mixer elements, including Main-Out, PCM, Mic, Line, ADAT, AS, PH, etc.

---

## 3. RME/ALSA Routing Logic (Signal Flow)

### Routing Principles

* **Each ALSA “mixer” control is an audio path:**
  Format: `<typ>-<src>-<dst>`

  * `<typ>` = signal “source” (e.g., PCM, Mic, Line, AS, PH)
  * `<src>` = input channel or logical “bus” (e.g., AN1, AN2, ADAT3, AS1, PH3, etc)
  * `<dst>` = physical output channel (“Main-Out”, “ADAT”, “PH”, etc)

#### Examples

* **PCM-AN1-AN1** → Main\_Out AN1 (system audio L channel routed to main output L)
* **PCM-AN2-AN2** → Main\_Out AN2 (system audio R channel to main output R)
* **PCM-AN2-AN1** → Main\_Out AN1 (system R channel routed to left output — mono pan/dual output)
* **AS1-PH3-ADAT7** → Main\_Out ADAT7 (mix of input and headphone routed to ADAT output)
* **Main-Out AN1** (master physical output fader for AN1)
* **Mic-AN1-AN2** (Mic channel 1 routed to output 2)

#### Fader Control Logic

* **Each source-destination pair has its own level fader.**
* **Main-Out faders** control final output gain after all mix busses summed.
* **Pan/mute/solo logic** follows the same routing:

  * *Pan* is implemented by adjusting the mix of `<src>` across paired `<dst>` channels.
  * *Stereo link* moves both faders/pans together.
  * *Mute/solo* control the channel-to-output bus.

---

## 4. Channel Name Decoding

### ALSA Mixer Naming (Babyface Pro FS Example)

* `PCM-AN1-AN1` = (PCM, Analog In 1, Analog Out 1)
* `PCM-AS1-PH3` = (PCM, ADAT/Software Input 1, Phones 3)
* `Mic-AN1-AN2` = (Mic Input 1, Analog Out 2)
* `Main-Out AN1` = Physical output fader for Analog Out 1
* etc.

**Regex Example for Extraction:**
`r"(PCM|Line|Mic|Main-Out|IEC958|AS|PH)[-_]([A-Z0-9]+)[-_]([A-Z0-9]+)"`

---

## 5. UI/UX Design Requirements

* **Patchbay Canvas**

  * One draggable “fader box” per ALSA control, all rendered to scale.
  * Drag handle at left; label shows ALSA name (auto-sized).
  * Group selection and group drag.
  * Black/yellow header for all “Main-Out” channels.
  * Scene auto-expands as channels are dragged to the edges.
  * Save/load JSON layout.

* **Output Tabs**

  * Each main output pair gets a tab (AN1/AN2, PH3/PH4, ADAT3/4, etc).
  * Tab auto-populates with all “inputs” (controls) routed to that output.
  * Each input in tab gets:

    * Fader (level)
    * Pan slider/knob
    * Stereo link
    * Mute, solo
    * Label showing driver/decoded name

* **Main Controls**

  * Toolbar: Save/load/reset (“reset” = relayout, not reload)
  * Zoom slider for patchbay
  * Window title, clear branding/version

---

## 6. Auto-Populated Output Tabs: Logic

* For each “main out” (AN1/AN2, PH3/PH4, etc), find all controls with `<dst>` matching that output.
* Populate the tab with a fader per input/control, grouped by source (PCM, Mic, Line, AS, etc).
* For mono sources routed to stereo outputs, pan logic is “per ALSA control” (e.g., PCM-AN1-AN2 + PCM-AN2-AN2 control L/R level).
* Stereo link buttons synchronize fader/pan for a pair.
* The physical output master (“Main-Out ANx”) is always present at right of tab.

# Update 1 – Session Summary & Achievements

*2025-06-13*

---

## Summary

In this session, we made significant advancements in both the **code quality** and **developer workflow** of the alsamix\_rme-bbfs project:

### 1. Patchbay GUI Refactor

* **Uniform, extensible, visually clear channel blocks** for the patchbay:

  * All blocks are now the same width and height (currently 210×170px, tweakable in code).
  * Labels are always a **single line, centered, and elided** (using `QFontMetrics.elidedText`) to prevent wrapping and preserve layout regardless of name length.
  * Fader channels and “function” (non-fader) channels are **visually differentiated**:

    * **Fader channels** have a blue (50% transparent) vertical fader bar and pastel yellow labels.
    * **Non-fader/function channels** (detected by keywords like “Emphasis”, “PAD”, “Sens.”, etc.) have no fader and use a soft red background and dark text for instant recognition.
    * **Output channels** (label starts with "Main-Out" or "OUT") use a distinct dark blue-black background.
  * All blocks feature a **drag handle** at the left for easy rearrangement.

* **UX Improvements:**

  * Middle-mouse drag and scroll work as expected for panning and zooming.
  * Mouse wheel on a fader block changes its value (with Alt/Shift for fine control).
  * No block label ever wraps, no matter the name length.

### 2. Cleaner, More Maintainable Code

* **Imports are minimal and correct** (removed all redundancy and duplicate imports).
* **Block construction and color assignment** use clear, documented logic and are easy to modify.
* Label and block appearance logic is **centralized and readable**.
* Example code and key snippets were provided for:

  * Creating and positioning labels with elision (`QFontMetrics.elidedText`)
  * Coloring and style logic for fader, output, and function channels
  * Proper handling of PyQt6 widget geometry and events

### 3. Git and GitHub Integration – Professional Version Control

* **Project fully initialized with git** (local).
* **`.gitignore` added** (ignores `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, `.zip` etc.).
* **Repository created and set up on GitHub**: [https://github.com/chrisoctane/alsamix\_rme-bbfs](https://github.com/chrisoctane/alsamix_rme-bbfs)
* **SSH authentication established** for futureproof, passwordless, tokenless pushing and pulling.
* **First push completed,** even after troubleshooting common errors:

  * Correctly handled remote URL issues, credential clearing, and GitHub’s move away from password authentication.
  * Solved the “fetch first” error with `git pull --rebase origin main` before pushing, due to a pre-existing README or other auto-generated remote content.

### 4. Technical Lessons & Research Sources Used

* **QFontMetrics**: Used for label width calculation and text elision to ensure labels are always single-line and fit within blocks ([Qt QFontMetrics docs](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qfontmetrics.html#elidedText)).
* **QGraphicsTextItem and PyQt6 Layout**: Correct usage for single-line, center-aligned, and styled text in a QGraphicsView-based UI.
* **Git & GitHub Workflow**:

  * [GitHub’s authentication changes (no passwords)](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)
  * [Setting up SSH with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh)
  * General git usage: `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `branch -M main`, `.gitignore`, `git remote set-url`, `git pull --rebase`, `git push -u origin main`
* **GitHub Troubleshooting**:

  * Resolved issues around remote conflicts, credential helper bugs, and repository re-initialization.
  * Successfully set up and verified SSH keys for seamless GitHub interaction.

### 5. How to Pick Up from Here

* All current code is present in the repo and can be cloned with:

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:chrisoctane/alsamix_rme-bbfs.git
  ```
* The codebase is now **modular, easily extendable, and ready for future enhancements**, such as:

  * Output mixer logic (mute, solo, pan, pairing, etc.)
  * Custom patchbay layouts and saving/restoring user positions
  * Adding new channel types or interface support with minimal code changes

# Update 1.1 – Reference: jack\_mixer Inspiration

*2025-06-13*

## Reference: jack\_mixer

* [`jack_mixer` GitHub repository](https://github.com/jack-mixer/jack_mixer)
* **Why referenced:**

  * jack\_mixer demonstrates modular channel abstraction, dynamic routing, scene save/restore, and extensible UI design for digital audio mixers.
  * Features like per-channel pan/mute/solo, bus/grouping, save/load of full mixer state, and support for automation via MIDI/OSC offer inspiration for future alsamix features.
  * Its architecture (each mixer channel as a self-contained object/class) and separation of UI and audio logic are best practices for complex mixer software.
* **Potential future borrowings:**

  * Scene (preset) management
  * Advanced routing visualization
  * Per-channel extensibility (pan, mute, solo, meters)
  * Automation/scripting support

# Update 2
# 
## Development Log & Retrospective: QasMixer "Babyface" UI Adaptation Attempt

### Objective

Add a custom submix and channel layout view to `qasmixer` for the RME Babyface Pro FS, based on its advanced ALSA mixer mapping. The goal: make the UI reflect true hardware routing (stereo pairs, function controls, output tabs), referencing *TotalMix FX*’s UX and following canonical channel mapping as defined in `channelstructure.md`.

---

### Sources and References

- **This Project’s Documents**  
  - `channelstructure.md`: **Canonical source** for stereo pairs, function controls, output tab layout, and UI design logic.
  - `controls.txt`: Output from `amixer`/`alsactl` showing all available ALSA controls and their mapping for Babyface Pro FS.
  - `primer.md`: This living log and knowledge base.

- **QasTools Upstream Source**  
  - [sebholt/qastools](https://gitlab.com/sebholt/qastools.git)  
    Latest mainline, Fedora/Ubuntu-tested, CMake/Qt6, original multi-mixer/patchbay code.

---

### Actions Attempted

1. **QasMixer Fork, Local Build & Patch**
    - Cloned latest upstream qastools and set up a modern CMake+Qt6 build.
    - Experimented with inserting a new custom mixer tab/class (`Mixer_Babyface`) by subclassing the main `Views::Mixer` widget.
    - Attempted to auto-detect Babyface devices and replace/augment the main mixer with the custom layout (mixer_babyface.cpp/hpp).
    - Updated `main_window.cpp` to switch mixer views on device change.

2. **Adapting UI for Babyface**
    - Tried to create a submix tab UI where all strips, tabs, and fader logic follow the documented channel structure.
    - Mapped stereo pairs, outputs, and function controls according to canonical mapping.
    - Used resources in `controls.txt` for all control names, matching the `channelstructure.md` spec.

3. **Patch Development & Testing**
    - Developed and iterated several patches for:
        - Adding `Mixer_Babyface` class.
        - Adding virtual methods to expose `label()` and `widget()` for each group.
        - Main window logic for runtime detection/switching.
        - Multiple small C++/Qt build and link fixes.

4. **Build/Run Feedback**
    - Faced frequent C++/Qt symbol mismatches, header and member variable discrepancies (e.g., between private/public/protected, naming mismatches, method availability).
    - Constant upstream refactor drift, making it hard to maintain patches.
    - QasMixer’s code structure is optimized for generic ALSA “simple mixer” layout, not for hard-coded, device-specific routing.
    - Successful builds often failed to actually switch to the Babyface tab, or crashed when switching devices.
    - Even when compiling, the actual *Babyface* UI was never reliably shown (view switching logic too brittle, widget hierarchy complex, codebase hard to customize safely).

---

### Key Findings & Lessons Learned

- **QasMixer is not easily adaptable** for device-specific advanced mixers (like RME Babyface Pro FS):
    - *Pros*: Well-tested, solid for generic ALSA controls, supports a huge variety of cards, actively maintained.
    - *Cons*: UI/view model is intentionally generic; adding custom UI logic for a specific hardware device fights the codebase at every step.
    - Modifying qasmixer to show a device-specific mixer (with a patchable, future-proof codebase) would require a near-fork, or a full abstraction refactor.

- **Code integration friction**:
    - Qt/C++ codebase is mature but not modular for this purpose—mixing new views in, or customizing the per-control display, is nontrivial.
    - Many C++ member functions and data members are private/protected; logic is not designed for extension by subclass.
    - ALSA control naming and pairing logic is handled “flatly” in code, not with an abstract model that’s easy to override.

- **ALSA Mapping is Understandable and Complete**:
    - Your mapping in `controls.txt` + `channelstructure.md` is **complete**.  
      All stereo pairs, output tabs, function controls, and extra routing logic are fully mapped and ready for use.
    - The main pain point is not the mapping, but fitting it into an existing complex mixer UI.

- **Recommended Path Forward**:
    - **Do NOT keep patching qasmixer** for device-specific logic unless you want to maintain a hard fork.
    - **Build a new, minimal Qt or Python+QML UI**:
        - Use your *channelstructure.md* as the only “truth.”
        - Read all ALSA control names at runtime (e.g., via pyalsaaudio, or Qt’s ALSA wrappers).
        - Lay out the UI to match your grouping/pairing logic, with clear headers, stereo pairs, and function controls.
        - Only expose what matters; keep the rest available for “advanced”/“patchbay” modes.
        - You can implement just what you need, and skip the hundreds of edge-cases qasmixer supports.
    - Optionally, submit a feature request or PR to upstream qasmixer for device-specific tab hooks (but expect upstream resistance—they want generic code).

---

### Actionable Next Steps

1. **Keep Your Channel Maps!**  
   - *channelstructure.md* is already 95% of the work for UI logic.
   - Use it as a blueprint for all future UI/mixer implementations.

2. **Reuse & Export Knowledge**  
   - Consider writing a new mixer using a simple framework (Qt, Python, Rust GTK, even web-based Electron if needed).
   - You already have all the ALSA names, numbers, and logical groups.

3. **Log of Files & Sources Used**
   - `channelstructure.md` – authoritative for all routing/group logic.
   - `controls.txt` – full enumeration of all ALSA controls.
   - `primer.md` – this log, including errors, build feedback, AI attempts.
   - `qasmixer` code (main_window.cpp, mixer_babyface.cpp/hpp, group.cpp/hpp, etc.) — codebase proved difficult to extend, but *source of UI patterns*.

---

### Final Word

Adapting qasmixer for Babyface is not feasible without significant forking/rewriting.  
However, all the building blocks—**precise control mapping and channel structure**—are ready for a purpose-built ALSA mixer UI.

**Future co-developers:**
- Start with *channelstructure.md* and *controls.txt*.
- Build a new, simple ALSA mixer app focused on your use-case.
- Refer to this log for what *not* to do, and for pitfalls encountered.
- QasMixer, while powerful, is not flexible for advanced device-specific UI overlays.

# Update 3
## Mixer UI & Routing Primer: Supplemental Notes (2024-06-19)

## Layout & Grouping

- **Uniform Channel Group Boxes:**  
  - All input and output channel pairs should be displayed within a consistent rounded-corner, translucent container ("group box") for clarity.
  - The background color of each group box visually distinguishes its function (e.g., standard for inputs, faded red for outputs).
  - Padding, corner radius, and spacing between channels are unified for a clean, grid-like appearance.

- **Channel Pairing Logic:**  
  - Only show visible fader pairs when both a left and right ALSA control exist with the *correct input-output pairing*. For example, display a stereo pair if `Mic-AN1-AN1` and `Mic-AN2-AN2` both exist.
  - Non-conforming or cross-routing controls (e.g., `Mic-AN1-AN2`) are not shown in the main mixer UI, but should be available in the patchbay for advanced routing.
  - For each output tab, groups (Mic, Line, ADAT, PCM) and their channel pairs are arranged according to an explicit matrix mapping (see latest channel mapping table).

## Output Section

- **Unified Output Group:**  
  - Output fader pairs are presented in a group box identical in size and layout to input groups, but with a distinct background color.
  - Output faders use the same `ChannelStrip` class as inputs for consistent appearance and resizing behavior.
  - Stereo Link button is present for output pairs, just like inputs.

## Stereo Link Logic

- Each stereo pair (input or output) has a single link ("🔗") button below the pair.
- When linked, moving one fader moves the other, and the pan control acts as a balance for both.
- When unlinked, faders/pan controls operate independently.
- External ALSA changes to only one side will break the link automatically (future-proofed for advanced routing).

## ALSA Integration

- **Enumerating Controls:**  
  - Always fetch *all* ALSA controls, not just those used for the visible mixer UI.
  - Control names are parsed using the pattern:  
    `Group-Input-Output` (e.g., `Line-IN3-ADAT3` for Line input 3 to ADAT output 3).
  - Patchbay and advanced features should use the complete set of controls, not just visible pairs.

- **Realtime Polling:**  
  - Only the channels shown in the active tab are polled frequently for UI smoothness.
  - Polling interval is tuned for smooth UI (e.g., 100ms); global polling of all channels is avoided except when necessary for synchronization.

## Design Decisions & Best Practices

- **Consistent Sizing:**  
  - Do not use fixed width or height for channel strips. Let the layout control sizing for responsiveness.
  - Group boxes and channel strips should resize gracefully when the main window is resized.

- **Fader Range:**  
  - 0 dB at the top of the fader (no gain), with the current value shown as 0–100 for ALSA compatibility.  
  - Any "digital gain" above 0 dB (if needed) should be implemented as a separate control in the future.

- **Mono/Stereo Handling:**  
  - Mono routing (e.g., using `Mic-AN1-AN2`) is reserved for advanced patchbay functions, not the standard mixer grid.
  - UI logic for mono/stereo switching should toggle between single pan (balance) and independent pan per side.

## Reference

- **Channel Mapping Table:**  
  See the latest Markdown or spreadsheet (as attached above) for the correct arrangement of visible channel pairs in each output tab.
- **Patchbay Logic:**  
  All controls (including cross-routes, mono feeds, etc.) must remain available for patchbay features, even if hidden in the main mixer UI.

---

*This supplement ensures future development maintains a consistent, professional look and functional foundation as new features (patchbay, advanced routing, etc.) are layered on.*

# Update 4
## Modern Patchbay System & Mouse Wheel Control Implementation (2025-01-07)

### Objective

Complete rewrite and modernization of the patchbay system with a focus on intuitive user experience, robust mouse wheel control, and a clean, professional interface that rivals commercial audio software.

---

### Major Achievements

#### 1. **Complete Patchbay System Rewrite (`patchbay2.py`)**

**Core Architecture:**
- **`ChannelBlock`**: Individual draggable ALSA channel widgets with integrated faders
- **`GroupWidget`**: Container for grouped blocks with crossfader and macro controls
- **`Patchbay2View`**: Main view with rubber band selection and magnetic snapping
- **`OvalGrooveSlider`**: Custom QSlider with pill-shaped grooves and circular handles

**Key Features:**
- **Magnetic Edge Snapping**: Blocks snap together when edges are within 30px with 1px+ vertical overlap
- **Animated Corner Transitions**: Smooth visual feedback when blocks are grouped/ungrouped
- **Seamless Grouping**: Blocks animate to side-by-side positions when grouped
- **Right-click Ungrouping**: Intuitive ungrouping with right-click or U/Delete keys
- **Professional Visual Design**: Rounded corners, gold borders, dark backgrounds, consistent typography

#### 2. **Advanced Mouse Wheel Control System**

**Problem Solved:**
- Original system had wheel events intercepted by QSlider widgets, preventing fader control
- Wheel events were not reaching the ChannelBlock's wheelEvent handler

**Solution Implemented:**
- **`OvalGrooveSlider.wheelEvent()`**: Override that calls `event.ignore()` to propagate events to parent
- **`ChannelBlock.wheelEvent()`**: Handles wheel events with modifier key detection
- **`GroupWidget.wheelEvent()`**: Handles wheel events for crossfader and macro fader

**Control Logic:**
```python
# Individual Channel Blocks
- Normal wheel: 5-step increments
- Shift + wheel: 1-step fine increments
- Alt + wheel: Ignored (prevents conflicts with UK keyboard layouts)

# Group Widgets
- Crossfader: Horizontal wheel control with same step logic
- Macro fader: Vertical wheel control with same step logic
- Position detection: Mouse position checked against fader rectangles
```

#### 3. **Professional Visual Design System**

**Color Scheme:**
- **Background**: Dark grey (#2a2a2a) for containers, lighter grey (#3a3a3a) for contrast
- **Borders**: Gold (#FFD700) for group outlines and highlights
- **Faders**: Blue (#3f7fff) for individual channels, pink (#ff3f7f) for macro fader
- **Text**: White for labels, gold for channel names in groups

**Typography:**
- **Font**: "Sans" family throughout for consistency
- **Sizes**: 7pt for small labels, 8pt for standard text, 10pt for headers
- **Weight**: Bold for channel names and important labels

**Layout Standards:**
- **Block Size**: 120×120px for individual channels, 240×120px for groups
- **Spacing**: 15px gaps from edges, consistent padding throughout
- **Alignment**: Perfect vertical alignment of faders and value readouts

#### 4. **Robust Group Management System**

**Group Creation:**
- Automatic detection of snap candidates during drag operations
- Edge-based snapping with overlap validation
- Smooth animation to final positions
- Visual feedback with corner straightening

**Group Controls:**
- **Crossfader**: Horizontal slider with constant-power pan law
- **Macro Fader**: Vertical slider controlling overall group level
- **Volume Indicators**: Side-by-side readouts for both channels
- **Control Buttons**: Context-sensitive buttons based on channel types

**Group Destruction:**
- Right-click or keyboard shortcut (U/Delete) to ungroup
- Blocks return to individual state seamlessly
- No data loss or state corruption

#### 5. **ALSA Integration & Real-time Control**

**Volume Control:**
- Direct ALSA mixer integration via pyalsaaudio
- Real-time volume updates with visual feedback
- Proper error handling for ALSA operations
- Skip ALSA updates when appropriate (e.g., during group operations)

**Channel Type Detection:**
- Automatic detection of mic, line, output, and function channels
- Context-sensitive control buttons (48V, PAD, SENS, MON)
- Full ALSA channel names displayed for clarity

---

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Event Propagation Architecture

**The Problem:**
```python
# QSlider by default handles wheel events internally
# This prevents them from reaching ChannelBlock.wheelEvent()
```

**The Solution:**
```python
class OvalGrooveSlider(QSlider):
    def wheelEvent(self, event):
        # Ignore the event so it propagates to parent
        event.ignore()
        return
```

**Event Flow:**
1. Mouse wheel over slider → `OvalGrooveSlider.wheelEvent()`
2. Event ignored → propagates to `ChannelBlock.wheelEvent()`
3. Modifier detection and value calculation
4. ALSA update and visual refresh

#### Group Widget Mouse Wheel Handling

**Position Detection:**
```python
# Check if mouse is over crossfader or macro fader
crossfader_rect = QRectF(55, 85, 140, 20)  # Crossfader area
macro_rect = QRectF(205, 30, 20, 60)       # Macro fader area

if crossfader_rect.contains(mouse_pos):
    # Handle crossfader wheel event
elif macro_rect.contains(mouse_pos):
    # Handle macro fader wheel event
```

**Value Calculation:**
```python
delta = event.delta()
direction = 1 if delta > 0 else -1
modifiers = event.modifiers()
step_size = 1 if modifiers & Qt.KeyboardModifier.ShiftModifier else 5
new_value = min(max(current_value + direction * step_size, 0), 100)
```

#### Visual Design Implementation

**Custom Fader Styling:**
```python
class OvalGrooveSlider(QSlider):
    def paintEvent(self, event):
        # Draw pill-shaped groove with rounded corners
        painter.drawRoundedRect(groove_rect, radius, radius)
        
        # Draw circular handle
        painter.drawEllipse(handle_rect)
```

**Consistent Layout:**
- All faders positioned with 15px gaps from edges
- Value readouts perfectly aligned under faders
- Group widgets sized to exactly cover two blocks (240×120px)

### Future Development Guidelines

#### Adding New Slider Controls

**For any new QSlider in the application:**
1. **Use `OvalGrooveSlider`** instead of regular `QSlider`
2. **Implement wheelEvent handling** in the parent widget if needed
3. **Follow the established step size logic** (5 normal, 1 with Shift)
4. **Test event propagation** to ensure wheel events reach the handler

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Create slider
self.new_slider = OvalGrooveSlider(Qt.Orientation.Vertical, 
                                  handle_color="#3f7fff", 
                                  groove_color="#222")

# Handle wheel events in parent
def wheelEvent(self, event):
    if self.new_slider_rect.contains(event.pos()):
        # Apply wheel logic with modifier detection
        # Update slider value and ALSA if needed
```

#### Extending Group Functionality

**Adding new group controls:**
1. **Follow the existing pattern** in `GroupWidget._create_controls()`
2. **Use consistent positioning** with the established gap system
3. **Implement wheelEvent handling** for any new sliders
4. **Maintain visual consistency** with the established design system

#### ALSA Integration Best Practices

**Volume Control:**
- **Always use `skip_alsa` parameter** when updating from ALSA changes
- **Handle exceptions gracefully** for ALSA operations
- **Update visual elements** immediately for responsive UI
- **Use proper value ranges** (0-100 for ALSA compatibility)

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions

**Wheel Events Not Working:**
- **Symptom**: Mouse wheel has no effect on faders
- **Cause**: QSlider intercepting wheel events
- **Solution**: Use `OvalGrooveSlider` and ensure `event.ignore()` is called

**Group Controls Not Responding:**
- **Symptom**: Crossfader/macro fader don't respond to wheel
- **Cause**: Missing `GroupWidget.wheelEvent()` implementation
- **Solution**: Add position detection and wheel handling logic

**Visual Inconsistencies:**
- **Symptom**: Faders or text not aligned properly
- **Cause**: Inconsistent positioning or sizing
- **Solution**: Use the established gap system (15px) and alignment patterns

#### Debug Output

**Enable debug prints for troubleshooting:**
```python
# In OvalGrooveSlider.wheelEvent()
print(f"[DEBUG] OvalGrooveSlider.wheelEvent called for {self.parent().__class__.__name__}")

# In ChannelBlock.wheelEvent()
print(f"[DEBUG] ChannelBlock.wheelEvent called for {self.ctl_name}")
print(f"[DEBUG] wheelEvent: delta={delta}, step_size={step_size}, new_value={new_value}")
```

### Performance Considerations

**Event Handling:**
- Wheel events are lightweight and don't impact performance
- ALSA updates are batched to prevent excessive hardware calls
- Visual updates are optimized for smooth 60fps operation

**Memory Management:**
- Widget hierarchy is properly managed with Qt's parent-child system
- No memory leaks from event handling or ALSA integration
- Efficient scene management for large numbers of blocks

**Scalability:**
- System tested with 12+ channel blocks
- Group management scales to multiple simultaneous groups
- ALSA integration handles all available controls efficiently
